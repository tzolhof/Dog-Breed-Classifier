# Dog-Breed-Classifier
Project for the Udacity's Machine Learning Course - Term 2

Dog Breed Classifier

This is a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

The repository includes:
* the Jupyter Notebook - iPython with all the steps of the project;
* the html report version of my work;
* this README file;
* the Additional_Images folder with the pictures used for testing my code;
* the lbpcascades xml file used for the optional exercise in the notebook.
